## Modelo de Previsão de Geração de Vento utilizando Redes Neurais

<br />

![Parque de Aracati](./parque_aracati.png)

O objetivo do trabalho é treinar uma rede neural de forma que seja possível prever a quantidade de vento em uma determinada região do Nordeste do Brasil. A quantidade de vento gerado é diretamente proporcional a quantidade de geração de energia fornecida por geradores eólicos, daí a grande importância de um modelo de previsão acurado. 

### Como funciona um gerador eólico

## 2 - Relatório de Dados

Em Docs/DataReport pode ser encontrado o relatório de dados do projeto [Relatório de dados](./DataReport/Report.md).

## 3 - Análise Exploratória de Dados

Em Code/Analysis existe o notebook [DataAnalysisExploration](../Code/Analysis/DataAnalysisExploration.ipynb). Neste notebook encontra-se a análise exploratória de dados responsável pelo melhor entendimento das informações do projeto.

## 4 - Preparação de Dados

Em Code/DataPrep existe o notebook [DataPreparation](../Code/DataPrep/DataPreparation.ipynb). Este notebook é reponsável pela preparação dos dados: higienização e conformidade, para que os dados possam ser utilizados pelos modelos de aprendizado de máquina.

## 5 - Modelagem

Em Code/Model existe o notebook [DataModeling](../Code/Model/DataModeling.ipynb). Neste notebook são aplicadas técnicas de aprendizado de máquina como clusterização por k-nearest neighbor (KNN) e Fatorização por Matriz não negativa (NMF) de forma a classificar e entender quais são as entidades mais importantes.
